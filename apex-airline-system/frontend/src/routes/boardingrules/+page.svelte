              Check-in: Complete the check-in process online or at the airport
              kiosk to obtain your boarding pass. This will contain your
              boarding group and any special instructions. Boarding Time: Keep
              an eye on the departure screens for your flight's boarding time.
              Boarding typically begins 30-45 minutes before departure. Gate
              Information: Proceed to your designated boarding gate when
              boarding commences.

              We utilize a boarding group system to prioritize passengers and
              ensure a smooth boarding process. Boarding groups are typically
              announced at the gate and displayed on your boarding pass.

              Boarding announcements will call specific boarding groups by
              number. Please wait at your designated waiting area until your
              group is called. For a faster boarding process, have your boarding
              pass readily available and any checked baggage tags detached for
              easy scanning.

              To maximize space and ensure a smooth boarding process, we
              recommend checking any larger carry-on luggage that won't fit
              under the seat in advance. We recommend placing any smaller
              belongings that can fit under the seat in front of you for easy
              access during the flight.

          <div>
            <p>
              Once on board, find your assigned seat and stow any carry-on
              luggage securely in the overhead compartment or under the seat in
              front of you. Please ensure your seat belt is securely fastened
              before takeoff and remain fastened throughout the flight until
              instructed by the crew.
